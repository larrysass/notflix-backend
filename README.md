This is the repo for the backend of my Netflix Clone.

This project is a clone of Netflix's frontend that also persists user data for login and keeping track of favorite movies/tv shows. [Click here for the frontend Repo](https://github.com/larrysass/notflix-frontend)


The backend is built in Rails and uses postgresql and ActiveRecord. Bcrypt and jwt are used for authentication/authorization.
